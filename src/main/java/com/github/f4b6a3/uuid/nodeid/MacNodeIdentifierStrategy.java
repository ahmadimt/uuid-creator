	 * MAC that is associated with the host name. Otherwise, it tries to find

	 * 
	 * (1) For UUID version 1, the node field consists of an IEEE 802 MAC
	 * address, usually the host address. For systems with multiple IEEE 802
	 * addresses, any available one can be used. The lowest addressed octet
	 * (octet number 10) contains the global/local bit and the unicast/multicast
	 * bit, and is the first octet of the address transmitted on an 802.3 LAN.
	 * 
	 * (2) For systems with no IEEE address, a randomly or pseudo-randomly
	 * generated value may be used; see Section 4.5. The multicast bit must be
	 * set in such addresses, in order that they will never conflict with
	 * addresses obtained from network cards.
